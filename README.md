# nix-doom-emacs

Nix expression to install and configure
[doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs).

The expression builds a `doom-emacs` distribution with dependencies
pre-installed based on an existing `~/.doom.d` directory.

It is not a fully fledged exprerience as some dependenices are not installed and
some may not be fully compatible as the version available in NixOS or
[emacs-overlay](https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay) may not be
compatible with the `doom-emacs` requirements.

## Getting started

Using [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager):

``` nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

let
  doom-emacs = pkgs.callPackage (builtins.fetchTarball {
    url = https://github.com/vlaci/nix-doom-emacs/archive/master.tar.gz;
  }) {
    doomPrivateDir = ./doom.d;  # Directory containing your config.el init.el
                                # and packages.el files
  };
in {
  home.packages = [ doom-emacs ];
  home.file.".emacs.d/init.el".text = ''
      (load "default.el")
  '';
}
```

Using `flake.nix`:

``` nix
{
  inputs = {
    home-manager.url = "github:rycee/home-manager";
    nix-doom-emacs.url = "github:vlaci/nix-doom-emacs/flake";
  };

  outputs = {
    self,
    nixpkgs,
    home-manager,
    nix-doom-emacs,
    ...
  }: {
    nixosConfigurations.exampleHost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
        {
          home-manager.users.exampleUser = { pkgs, ... }: {
            imports = [ nix-doom-emacs.hmModule ];
            home.doom-emacs = {
              enable = true;
              doomPrivateDir = ./doom.d;
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

## Under the hood

This expression leverages
[nix-straight.el](https://github.com/vlaci/nix-straight.el) under the hood for
installing depdendencies. The restrictions of that package apply here too.

## Usage

instead of running emacs.d/bin/doom, once you have update your config files (packages.el, init.el, config.el), rebuild doom-emacs with nix. If you are using home-manager, simply run `home-manager switch`

## Troubleshooting

On macOS on a fresh install, you might run into the error `Too many files open`. running `ulimit -S -n 2048` will only work for the duration of your shell and will fix the error

## Installing emacs packages

In the initial packages.el instructions for how to install packages can be found.
However some packages might require a particular software dependency to be installed.
Trying to install those would give you an error of the type:
`Searching for program: No such file or directory, git` (Missing git dependency)
Here is how you would go installing [magit-delta](https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta) for example (which requires git).

under the line:
`doomPrivateDir = ./doom.d;`
in your configuration, you would add the following:

```Nix
  emacsPackagesOverlay = self: super: {
     magit-delta = super.magit-delta.overrideAttrs (esuper: {
       buildInputs = esuper.buildInputs ++ [ pkgs.git ];
     });
  };
```
to make the git dependency available.
trying to rebuild doom-emacs with `home-manager switch` should work correctly now.
